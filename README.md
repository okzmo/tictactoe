# tictactoe
Simple tic tac toe in C

To use it you'll need gcc or any compiler that can compile C code.

When you have one you can execute this command (or a command similar to this one if you don't use gcc)
`gcc main.c`

This will generate an executable that you can use:
`.\a.exe`

Of course this will work only if you use windows as your OS but in the case you use either mac or linux you can use:
`./a`
